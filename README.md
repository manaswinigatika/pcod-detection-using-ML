This machine learning project predicts Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) by analyzing clinical and symptom data, employing techniques like correlation analysis, Chi-Square tests, and mutual information for feature selection. Key models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and SVM were optimized and combined into Voting/Stacking ensembles to enhance accuracy, while SHAP values provided transparent interpretations of feature impacts. Built with Python (scikit-learn, pandas), the end-to-end pipeline—from preprocessing to deployment-ready models—showcases strong skills in data engineering, model tuning, and explainable AI, emphasizing real-world healthcare applications for early diagnosis of a condition affecting millions globally.
